Hi! My name is Roger.

As an up-and-coming follower of computer science, I find myself irresistibly attracted to the realm of game development, game conception, and anything associated with the creative arts. My curious disposition impels me towards a deep-rooted thirst for knowledge and proficiency in the intricacies of this fascinating field, as I strive towards reaching the pinnacle of expertise in the elusive art of game design. To this end, I am constantly sharpening my abilities and refining my techniques, as I endeavor to broaden the boundaries of my understanding and propel myself ever forward in the relentless pursuit of technical finesse and aesthetic excellence. Whether it be through the nuanced subtleties of programming, the delicate brushstrokes of visual art, or the sublime intricacies of design theory, my heart beats with a passion for the artistry and refinement of this captivating discipline.
